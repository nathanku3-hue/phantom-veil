# Worker Done / PM Brief Contract

Status: Template
Purpose: capture a MECE PM/CEO-facing worker report: what changed, why it matters, blockers, decision needed, next action, evidence, and accountability before handoff or reconciliation.

## Worker Accountability

```text

Rules:
- The first non-empty line of generated worker-report artifacts must be `# Worker PM Brief`.
- The first visible fields after the title must remain `Outcome`, `Round`, `Progress`, and `Confidence`.
- Generated worker reports must include `Ship gate tier` and `Task resolution` immediately after `Updated`.
- The first section after metadata must answer what actually changed.
- The Ship-Fast Decision Gate concept is visible in top metadata and folded into `## What decision is needed`: one decision, options considered, scope limit, and stop rule.
- Do not begin with `# Worker Report`, numbered logs, SAW Verdict, ClosurePacket, or command logs.
- Do not lead with command logs, reviewer chatter, or numbered SAW/logsheet detail.
- SAW Verdict, ClosurePacket, ClosureValidation, and SAWBlockValidation are evidence only and must appear under `## Validation / evidence` or evidence artifacts.
- Evidence artifacts are files, reports, commits, hashes, or zips; they are not the same field as passed validations.
- If requested work was not performed, set `Outcome: PARTIAL_WITH_EXPLICIT_SCOPE` or `REJECTED` and name the blocker.
- Missing `requested_work_type` or `actual_work_type_performed` fails closed.
- `requested_work_type` cannot be `none`.
- `actual_work_type_performed: none` requires `Outcome: PARTIAL_WITH_EXPLICIT_SCOPE` or `REJECTED` and a blocker.
- `PARTIAL_WITH_EXPLICIT_SCOPE` and `REJECTED` require a blocker that is not empty or `none`.
- Silent docs-only fallback from code, test, provider_probe, commit, validation, execution, or data_output work is forbidden.
